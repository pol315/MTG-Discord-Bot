# MTG-Discord-Bot
A Discord bot to search for and display Magic: The Gathering cards, their prices and relevant information.

A config.ini file must be created in the same directory as the mtg.py file. The syntax of the ini file should look like this:

```
[Discord]
SecretToken=mysecretesttokengoeshere
```

This is for telling the bot what token it should use (generated by Discord) to authenticate and connect to the right server.

I've also included my zdaemon scripts to start, stop, and restart the bot to run as a service in the background.
