# MTG-Discord-Bot
A Discord bot to search for and display Magic: The Gathering cards, their prices and relevant information.

A config.ini file must be created in the same directory as the mtg.py file. The syntax of the ini file should look like this:

```
[Discord]
SecretToken=mysecretesttokengoeshere
```

This is for telling the bot what token it should use (generated by Discord) to authenticate and connect to the right server.
